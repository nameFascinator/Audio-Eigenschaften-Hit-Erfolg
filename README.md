# Audio-Eigenschaften-Hit-Erfolg (Audio Features & Hit Success)
Audio features vs. chart success - code &amp; figures for our HTW Berlin Data Science project: Spotify/Kaggle data - EDA - logistic-regression baseline (AUC ~ 0.80) - presentation slides.

# Audio Features & Hit Success
Data-science mini-study (HTW Berlin, SS 2025)

We ask a simple question: can pure audio features explain which songs become hits?
Using four Kaggle datasets + Spotify Audio Features API we show that nine numeric descriptors already deliver 73% accuracy / 0.80 ROC-AUC in a logistic baseline - and reveal which metrics matter most.
